1-In sql change bgpanel to your database name and bgp_ to your DB prefix.
2-Run sql script to create the new 2 tables.
3-I didn't edited another files to add links to panel so you got to do it manually sorry :(.

Hope you like this contribution, i used SVN but i dont have a idea how to make a git patch. :/
